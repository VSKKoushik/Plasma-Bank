# Plasma-Bank
This is a mini project done for our subject course. The Software's used for this project are python, Tkinter, SQLite-3
With no proven treatment guidelines for COVID-19, 'Human Convalescent Plasma' is an option and has been under trial worldwide. 
The purpose of this Application that we were introducing is to analyze the challenges encountered in the collection of convalescent plasma from COVID recovered patients and to rectify them. 
The major difficulty faced during the collection of convalescent plasma by the victim from the discharged patients is that the recovered patients were contacted TELEPHONICALLY, mostly through social media, Which results in a drastic amount of wastage of time. 
This may lead to a threat to the life of the patient. 
It also leads to a huge financial expense for the advertising of the requirements. 
This project is a high-quality software to manage all these consequences. 
Precisely This is an application created for requesting CPP by checking the availability of the blood type and donors interested in donating blood. 
It also helps in searching the nearby banks and hospitals by using this application.
